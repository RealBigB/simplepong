simplepong
==========

One more pygame-based pong game - just for learning, really. 
Based on http://www.pygame.org/docs/tut/tom/MakeGames.html

Requirements
------------
- python 2.7.x (tested on 2.7.3)
- pygame 1.9.x (tested on 1.9.1)


Install
------------

Well, none ATM, just put this anywhere and cd anywhere/src

Usage
------------

python batball.py

Keybindings
------------

- Player 1 (left): 'a' (up), 'q' (down)
- Player 2 (right): 'arrow up', 'arrow down'
- anyone: 'space' pauses the game.


The code is ugly as sin ATM, this is my very first attempt at game progamming, and the result of a couple hours hacking around the tutorial version. Don't hold it against me.
